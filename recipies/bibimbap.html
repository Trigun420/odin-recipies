        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
            <p>Mix soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger together in a bowl. Add beef brisket and cover with plastic wrap. <br> Marinate in the refrigerator for for 30 minutes.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
            <p>Rinse rice until water turns clear. Pour into a rice cooker and add 1 1/2 cups water. Seal and select setting according to manufacturer's instructions; <br> cook until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Keep warm..</p>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
            <p>Place mushrooms in a bowl of warm water. Soak for 20 minutes..</p>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
            <p>Coat eggplant with salt on all sides and allow to 'sweat,' about 10 minutes. Rinse with cool water.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
            <p>Squeeze the water out of the re-hydrated shiitake mushrooms and slice into 1/4-inch strips.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
            <p>Heat 2 tablespoons sesame oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. <br> Transfer to a covered plate to keep warm.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 7</strong></li>
            <p>Saute eggplant in the same skillet until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the plate with the mushrooms.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 8</strong></li>
            <p>Place squash in the hot skillet; cook and stir until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. <br> Add to the plate with the eggplant and mushrooms; keep vegetables warm.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 9</strong></li>
            <p>Saute carrots and broccoli in the skillet until slightly tender, about 6 minutes. Transfer to the plate with rest of the vegetables.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 10</strong></li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add sprouts and cook uncovered until tender but still crispy, about 2 minutes. <br> Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 11</strong></li>
            <p>Heat the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add marinated beef slices and saute until nicely browned and lightly pink in the center, about 7 minutes..</p>
        <li><strong>Step 12</strong></li>
            <p>Place approximately 1 cup cooked rice in each bowl. Season with remaining sesame oil and vinegar. Pat rice down with a spoon to make a mound. <br> Cover with a bed of lettuce. Add small mounds of cooked mushrooms, eggplant, squash, carrots, and broccoli on the lettuce around the edge of the bowl. <br> Place beef in the center.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 13</strong></li>
            <p>Heat the skillet over medium heat. Break eggs into skillet and season with salt. Cook until whites are just set and yolks are slightly runny, about 3 minutes. Place a sunnyside-up egg on top of the beef in each bowl. Top with radish and green onion.</p>
               
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
       <p>  If you can get to a Korean market, the prices on the listed items are much lower than in a conventional grocery store. <br>
            I would like to try this with kosari (fern brakes) sometime, as I love the flavor, but I haven't undertaken the seemingly daunting task of preparing the dried ones as of yet.</p>
